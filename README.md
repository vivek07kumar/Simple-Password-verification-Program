# Simple-Password-verification-Program
This is a simple password verification program written in Python.



■ Below is how the program behaves.


1》 The program asks user to input a password.

2》Then it checks for equality of user input with predefined password.

3》If user input is found different from predefined password then a message saying error password
is displayed and user is asked again to enter password. Program asks user only
3 times to enter password. If user fails to enter correct password all of the 3 times then program 
prints a message saying 'too many failed attempts' and then program terminates.

4》 If user input matches with pre-defined password then program greets user by printing a message saying 
'correct password' and then program terminates.
